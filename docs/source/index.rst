Globus Action Provider - Python SDK
=====================================

This SDK is a Python framework for creating Action Providers for
invocation via `Globus Flows <https://docs.globus.org/api/flows/>`_.

The *Globus Flows* service
provides a means of coordinating multiple actions across potentially long
periods of time to perform orchestration of complex processes.

Actions require a uniform interface for invocation, monitoring, and termination.
We refer to the service endpoints which can be invoked
in this manner as *Action Providers* and this uniform interface for interacting
with Action Providers as the *Action Provider Interface*.

This toolkit is experimental and no support is implied for any sort of use of
this package. It is published for ease of distribution among those planning
to use it for its intended experimental purpose.
